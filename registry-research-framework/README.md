# Registry Research Framework

This folder holds the v3.1 machine pipeline for undocumented registry research.

- `pipeline/` runs the phase-based workflow and writes canonical per-record outputs under `evidence/records/`.
- `routing/` chooses the tool lane and applies Frida kernel guard.
- `tools/` contains thin wrappers for runtime, static, and behavior probes.
- `schemas/` defines the v3.1 machine evidence formats.
- `audit/` generates the retroactive re-audit queue and report.
- `config/` stores batch, routing, decision-tree defaults, and tweak-to-VM runner mappings.
- `docs/` explains the v3.1 rules without changing the existing human-facing research record schema.

Canonical imported artifacts live under `evidence/files/`. The published research surface stays under `research/`.

`faz1` and `faz3` stay bootstrap-only by default. Pass `-ExecuteTools` when you want the phase wrapper to call the mapped VM runner for that tweak. `faz1` can now emit both ETW and Procmon lane manifests.
